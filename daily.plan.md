## 90-Minute DSA Revision Plan

### Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Divided into three focused sections:

---

### Part 1: Searching and Sorting (35 minutes)

**Binary Search (15 mins)**

* Revise the standard binary search algorithm and its common variants:

  * First and last occurrence of an element
  * Lower and upper bound
  * Binary search on answer (used in problems like “search in rotated array” or “minimum largest subarray sum”)

**Sorting Techniques (20 mins)**

* QuickSort: Partition logic, recursion, in-place operation
* MergeSort: Divide and conquer, used often in linked list problems
* Count/Bucket Sort: For problems with limited integer ranges
* Know where to use custom comparators or sort by second element

---

### Part 2: Data Structures – Traversals and Operations (45 minutes)

**Arrays and Strings (5 mins)**

* Basic traversals and manipulations
* Use of prefix sum and hash map for frequency/count
* Understand two-pointer usage in sorted arrays and sliding window usage in substrings

**Linked Lists (5 mins)**

* Reversal (iterative and recursive)
* Cycle detection using fast/slow pointers
* Finding middle element

**Stacks and Queues (5 mins)**

* Stack: Next greater element, parentheses validation, monotonic stack problems
* Queue: BFS logic, sliding window maximum

**Trees (10 mins)**

* Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (recursive and iterative)
* Level-order traversal using queue
* Depth calculation, max/min leaf level, BST validation

**Graphs (10 mins)**

* DFS using recursion or stack
* BFS using queue
* Use of visited set to prevent cycles
* Graph representation: adjacency list vs matrix

**Heaps (5 mins)**

* Max and min heap logic
* Priority queues for top-K problems
* Common heap operations: insert, pop, heapify

**HashMap and Set (5 mins)**

* Frequency counting, duplicates
* Constant-time lookup
* Set usage for unique elements and cycle detection in graphs or linked lists

---

### Part 3: Pattern Recall and Mapping (10 minutes)

* Recall key patterns: two pointers, sliding window, binary search, DFS/BFS, backtracking, monotonic stack, prefix sum
* Quickly list 2–3 LeetCode problems that use each pattern
* Visualize mapping:

  * Which DS is associated with which pattern
  * What operations are most common
  * How these show up in OA/interview rounds

---

### Output

This 90-minute session helps you:

* Quickly recall and mentally simulate standard algorithms
* Revise how to traverse and perform basic operations on every key data structure
* Reinforce core problem-solving patterns commonly tested in coding interviews and online assessments
