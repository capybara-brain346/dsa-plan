- Retry any unsolved or challenging problems from the week.

### Tips

- Focus on **tree/graph traversal** techniques (DFS/BFS), recursive/tree patterns, and heap manipulation.
- For each problem: implement at least one iterative and one recursive solution, where possible.
- Take notes on each new technique or algorithm, as these patterns recur frequently in interviews.
