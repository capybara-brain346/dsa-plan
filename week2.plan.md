- Review any missed or tough problems from the week.

**Tips:**
- If stuck, review editorial/solutions and retry next day.
- Each day’s set can be tackled in 60–90min, balancing depth and variety.
- This plan ensures you practice both foundational problems and advanced variations, mirroring real coding interview settings.
