## Day 1: Tries & Hash-String Patterns

- [208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/) – Build/understand the Trie data structure, including insert, search, and prefix operations[1][2][3][4].
- [211. Add and Search Word - Data structure design] – Trie + word search with '.' wildcard.
- [212. Word Search II] – Use Trie for efficient multi-word grid search.

## Day 2: Classic Dynamic Programming

- [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/) – Simple DP/fibonacci-style problem, often the DP intro for interviews[5][6][7][8][9].
- [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/) – Standard unbounded knapsack DP, covers recursion, memoization, and tabular DP[10][11][12][13].
- [198. House Robber] – Another linear DP (rob houses with no adjacent theft).

## Day 3: DP Continued & Combinations

- [139. Word Break] – DP plus hash set for substring segmentation.
- [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence]
- [62. Unique Paths] – Classic grid DP.
- (Optional: [518. Coin Change II] for combinations, not permutations.)

## Day 4: Consolidate Missed or Difficult Problems

- Revisit any problems from weeks 1–3 that you couldn't solve quickly or had to read solutions for (arrays, strings, linked lists, sliding window, graphs/trees, intervals, heap).

## Day 5: Blind 75 Mixed Practice

Pick a mix from the [Blind 75 list](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/oizxjoit/) to cover weak topics or common patterns:[14][15][16][17][18]

- Arrays/Strings: "Product of Array Except Self", "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters".
- Trees/Graphs: "Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum", "Number of Islands".
- DP: "Longest Increasing Subsequence", "House Robber II".
- Hashing: "Group Anagrams".

## Day 6: Simulate Interview Rounds

- Set a timer (e.g., 1hr) and attempt 2–3 Blind 75 problems chosen at random, coding on paper or whiteboard style.
- For each, talk through your approach out loud, test multiple edge cases, and check time/space complexity.

## Day 7: Full Review & Final Simulation

- Pick 4–5 problems from any weak topics, Blind 75, or revisit ones you struggled with earlier in the week.
- Treat each as a full interview round, focusing on clear explanations, coding accuracy, and edge cases.

## Tips:
- Each day’s set is designed for 90–120 minutes, keeping things focused but realistic.
- If time is limited, prioritize Trie, Climbing Stairs, Coin Change, and high-frequency problems from Blind 75.
- On review/simulation days, write code by hand and aim to fully debug before “submitting”.
