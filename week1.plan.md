### Tips:

- If you have extra time, try harder variants (e.g., 560. Subarray Sum Equals K, 15. 3Sum).
- If a problem is too difficult, read the editorial and revisit in the review session.
- This list gets you comfortable with critical patterns necessary for interviews and future topics.

Happy coding!
